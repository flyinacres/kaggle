Attempting to figure out how to submit this info took way too long.  \n\nOne key: When searching on Google ensure that you only look for results in the past year. Otherwise outdated results for Kaggle predominate.\n\nThis site was of some use: https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/questions-and-answers/518559\n\nBut the key step was to go back to the submissions page: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e4/submissions\nand notice that a Late Submission button exist. This is a crap UI as the 'button' does not have an outline so is almost undetectable in dark mode.\n\nOnce I found that button my submission quickly worked.  Now to figure out how good the solution is.  Kaggle shows my results, but gives no\ncontext as to how that compares to anything else.\n\nMy initial results: private score 0.16294, public score 0.16208\n\nThe leaderboard shows that the best results are around 0.14374\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e4/leaderboard\n\nThe differences into the hundreds of positions are tiny--around 0.00126\n\nI assume the leaderboard only reflects submissions made before the deadline.","metadata":{}}]}
