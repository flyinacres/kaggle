Similarly, we can replace the category by the frequency -or percentage- of observations in the dataset. That is, if 10 of our 100 observations show the colour blue, we would replace blue by 10 if doing count encoding, or by 0.1 if replacing by the frequency. These techniques capture the representation of each label in a dataset, but the encoding may not necessarily be predictive of the outcome. These are however, very popular encoding methods in Kaggle competitions.\n\nThe assumption of this technique is that the number observations shown by each variable is somewhat informative of the predictive power of the category.\n\n\n### Advantages\n\n- Simple\n- Does not expand the feature space\n\n### Disadvantages\n\n- If 2 different categories appear the same amount of times in the dataset, that is, they appear in the same number of observations, they will be replaced by the same number: may lose valuable information.\n\nFor example, if there are 10 observations for the category blue and 10 observations for the category red, both will be replaced by 10, and therefore, after the encoding, will appear to be the same thing. \n\n\nFollow this [thread in Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/general/16927) for more information.\n\n\n\n## In this demo:\n\nWe will see how to perform count or frequency encoding with Feature-Engine using the House Prices dataset.\n\nFor guidelines to obtain the dataset check **section 2** of the course.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip uninstall -y scikit-learn\n!pip install
